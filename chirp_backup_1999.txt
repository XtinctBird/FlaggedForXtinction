Dear Diary,  
Today I saw a cat staring at me. I chirped extra loud to show who’s boss.  
Then, I spent the day perfecting my tweet. It goes like this:  
“Chirp chirp. Flag not found. Chirp chirp.”  

Oh, also, some human is digging through my files.  
Hey, human! Stop snooping. Or at least bring birdseed.  

That’s it for today.  
P.S. You’re not going to find the flag here.
