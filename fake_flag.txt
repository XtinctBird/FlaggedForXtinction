Let me clear this up right now: THIS IS NOT THE FLAG.  
Seriously, it's not. But since you're here, enjoy some totally unrelated and random trivia:

- Fun fact: Birds are technically *modern-day dinosaurs*â€¦ Does that make me a dino too? ðŸ¦–  
- You canâ€™t hum while holding your nose. Go ahead, try it. Iâ€™ll wait.  
- Want to hear a joke about construction?  Iâ€™m still working on it. ðŸ”¨  
- Speaking of distraction: The real flag isnâ€™t this obvious, is it? *Wink wink.*  
- Cats sleep for 70% of their lives...  The other 30% is spent judging you. ðŸ’¤  
- Did you know? Cats are secretly plotting world domination.

And while you're pondering lifeâ€™s mysteries...
