How to Decode the Flag:  
Step 1: Search for clues in every file. Don’t skip any!  
Step 2: If you find a suspicious link, click it without hesitation.  
Step 3: Never trust a file that says “this isn’t the flag.” Sometimes it is. Or is it?  
Step 4: Repeat steps 1-3 until you realize you’ve been trolled.  

Good luck, brave explorer.  
The bird believes in you.
